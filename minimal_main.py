    Play games between two agents with role swapping.

    ----------
    generate_move_1 : GenMove
        Move generator for the first agent.
    generate_move_2 : GenMove, optional
        Move generator for the second agent (default is user_move).
    player_1 : str, optional
        Name for the first agent.
    player_2 : str, optional
        Name for the second agent.
    args_1 : tuple, optional
        Extra arguments for the first agent's move generator.
    args_2 : tuple, optional
        Extra arguments for the second agent's move generator.
    init_1 : Callable, optional
        Initialization function for the first agent.
